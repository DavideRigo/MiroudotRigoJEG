This repository contains the code underlying the paper "Multinational Production and Investment Provisions in Preferential Trade Agreements" by SÃ©bastien Miroudot and Davide Rigo.

This is a complete replication package that produces all results from scratch using Stata.

The package includes our novel database on multinational production (input/mp_data.dta) and all the codes to generate the figures and tables in the paper.
